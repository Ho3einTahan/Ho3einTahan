I'm Hosein Tahan — a passionate and detail-oriented software developer who believes in writing clean, maintainable code and continuously learning and improving.  
I specialize in **server-side development** with Node.js and I'm also highly skilled in **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile apps.

I love what I do, and I'm always looking for exciting new challenges and opportunities to grow.
